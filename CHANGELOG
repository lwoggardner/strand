== 0.2.0
New features
* Strand now implements many more ::Thread methods and equivalents for ::Queue and ::Mutex
* Strand is now a module that behaves like a class. Strand.new will return a ::Thread or a Strand::EM::Thread
  depending on whether it is running within the EventMachine reactor or not
     
Changes
* EventMachine is now an optional dependency (because it can work without EM)
* Strand.yield and Strand.resume can now take arguments (like Fiber)
* Final call to Strand.resume will return strand's value (or exception)
* Normalize access to strand local variables (converts everything to symbols interally)
